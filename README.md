The main purpose of this project is to maintain your skills in data engineering, data visualization, data science, and machine learning.
First, we pick Boston Airbnb Dataset 
data from Seattle and Boston Airbnb homes can be used to understand how much Airbnb homes are earning in certain time frames and areas. You can compare rates between the two cities, or try to understand if there is anything about the properties that help you predict prices. Can you find negative and positive reviews based on the text? This dataset requires several skills beyond those shown thus far in the course, but if you would like a challenge, this will certainly test your ability to work with messy, real-world data.
Second, I tried to understand the business and I can get value from it, After that, you need to create 3 questions to answer from the data.
Third, I started cleaning the data and visualization.
Forth I create the model.
